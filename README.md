# HashGenerator
Generate hashes from a wordlist or pattern.

'Old' Branch has the original script I wrote. This script was originally written for a couple challenges in the NCL hacking competition last semester. Sure there's better tools that do this already such as HashCat, but this was a good learning experience, so here we are.

#TODO:
 - Add GUI
  - Will have options for altering how the wordlists are joined and for adding numbers at the end
  - Dropdown for selecting hash type?
  - Display sample of the output in GUI as a test before generating full file
 - Add Error handling and Unit tests
